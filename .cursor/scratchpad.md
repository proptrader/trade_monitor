# Background and Motivation
The project is moving to a SPA/HTMX navigation model for a more app-like experience. The navigation bar will now include a Trades tab (for live/all trades) and a Dashboard tab (for summary/overview). The main page will be blank. All navigation will use HTMX for partial updates, and active tab styling will be managed via JavaScript.

Recently, we encountered a critical issue where the Dashboard Overview and Export to Google Sheets functionality only worked when Tailwind CSS was disabled. This required a comprehensive approach to fixing the interaction between the HTMX/SPA architecture and Tailwind CSS.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Ensuring all content routes return partials, not full HTML pages.
- Updating all navigation and JS to use `/trades` instead of `/dashboard` for the trades tab.
- Implementing a summary dashboard for account/trade stats.
- Managing active tab styling in a SPA context.
- **Critical Issue**: Dashboard Overview and Export to Google Sheets functionality not working with Tailwind CSS enabled.
  - Root cause: Tailwind was interfering with JavaScript initialization and DOM visibility.
  - Tailwind's on-demand CSS was causing timing issues with component initialization.
  - Inconsistent element visibility when Tailwind was loaded versus disabled.

# High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] Update navigation bar in `base.html`:
    - Add "Trades" tab after "Dashboard".
    - Use `hx-get`, `hx-target`, and `hx-push-url` for all tabs.
    - Set `href` to `/dashboard`, `/trades`, `/accounts`, `/logs` as appropriate.
- [x] Update Flask routes:
    - `/dashboard` returns summary/overview partial (active accounts, trades per account, trades copied).
    - `/trades` returns live/all trades tabbed interface partial.
    - `/` returns a blank partial.
- [x] Update all navigation and JS references from `/dashboard` to `/trades` for the trades tab.
- [x] Implement JavaScript logic to update active tab styling on click.
- [x] Ensure all content pages are returned as partials (not full HTML).
- [x] Test navigation, content loading, and active tab styling.
- [x] **Fix Dashboard Overview and Export functionality with Tailwind enabled**:
    - Create robust Tailwind state detection and initialization system.
    - Add fallback styling to ensure visibility with or without Tailwind.
    - Implement multiple export methods for greater reliability.
    - Create comprehensive debugging panels to track DOM state and API calls.

# Fixed Issues - Detailed Changes
## 1. Base HTML Enhancements
- Added global `tailwindLoaded` state tracker to reliably detect when Tailwind is fully loaded
- Created `runWhenTailwindReady` utility function to ensure code runs only after Tailwind is ready
- Added helper functions `elementExists` and `waitForElement` to locate DOM elements reliably
- Made `showToast` globally available via `window.showToast` for use in any loaded partial
- Implemented a custom `tailwind:ready` event that triggers when Tailwind is fully initialized
- Added a secondary `components:initialize` event to ensure all components are initialized in the right order

## 2. Dashboard Summary Improvements
- Added inline styles as fallbacks to ensure content is visible regardless of CSS state
- Created a CSS visibility enforcement mechanism with !important rules
- Added multiple initialization paths to handle different loading scenarios
- Enhanced debugging tools to track DOM state and API calls
- Created a fallback for `showToast` when loaded as a standalone partial
- Forced visibility of key elements with explicit style overrides
- Implemented both event-based and timeout-based initialization

## 3. Export Functionality Fixes

- Add inline styles with !important rules to override potentially conflicting styles.
- Use event delegation for dynamically created elements.
- Track DOM mutations to respond to dynamic content changes.

# Trade Monitor - Access Token Initialization Plan

## Background and Motivation
- The application needs to initialize access tokens to empty strings at the start of each day
- This should only happen once per day when the app is first run
- This ensures a clean state for token management each day

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Need to track when the app was last initialized
2. Need to determine if it's a new day
3. Need to modify the access tokens in the config file
4. Need to ensure this happens only once per day
5. Need to handle this during app startup

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create a new initialization tracking file
   - Create `config/init_tracker.json` to store last initialization date
   - Success Criteria: File exists with proper structure

2. Add initialization check function to KiteService
   - Add method to check if initialization is needed
   - Compare current date with last initialization date
   - Success Criteria: Function correctly identifies when initialization is needed

3. Add token reset functionality
   - Add method to reset access tokens
   - Update config file with empty tokens
   - Update initialization tracker
   - Success Criteria: Tokens are reset and tracker is updated

4. Integrate with app startup
   - Modify app initialization to perform the check
   - Call token reset if needed
   - Success Criteria: Initialization happens automatically on app startup

## Project Status Board
- [x] Task 1: Create initialization tracker file

2. Added `_check_and_reset_tokens()` method to KiteService
3. Modified `load_accounts()` to perform token reset check
4. Added INIT_TRACKER_PATH to app configuration

The implementation:
- Checks if token reset is needed by comparing current date with last initialization date
- Resets all access tokens to empty strings when needed
- Updates the tracker file with the current date after reset
- Handles all error cases with proper logging
- Only performs reset once per day on first run

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Implementation is complete and ready for testing. The system will now:
1. Initialize access tokens to empty strings at the start of each day
2. Only perform initialization once per day
3. Track initialization state in `config/init_tracker.json`
4. Handle all error cases gracefully with proper logging

## Lessons
- Always ensure proper date comparison using ISO format
- Keep track of initialization state in a separate file
- Handle file operations safely with proper error handling
- Use app configuration for file paths
- Implement comprehensive logging for debugging

# Template Rendering Fix Plan

## Background and Motivation
- When refreshing any page, the base template is not being rendered
- Only partial content is being returned, causing layout issues
- Need to properly handle both full page loads and HTMX requests

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Routes are returning partial templates directly
2. No distinction between full page loads and HTMX requests
3. No template inheritance structure
4. Need to maintain HTMX functionality while fixing page refreshes

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Modify base template to support template inheritance
   - Add Jinja2 block for content
   - Move navigation to base template
   - Success Criteria: Base template has proper block structure
   âœ“ COMPLETED: Added title, head, content, and scripts blocks to base.html

2. Update content templates to extend base template
   - Modify dashboard_summary.html
   - Modify dashboard.html
   - Modify accounts.html
   - Modify logs.html
   - Success Criteria: All templates properly extend base.html
   âœ“ COMPLETED: Updated dashboard_summary.html with proper template inheritance

3. Create partial templates for HTMX requests
   - Create partials directory
   - Create partial versions of each template
   - Success Criteria: Partial templates exist without base template inheritance
   âœ“ COMPLETED: Created partials/dashboard_summary.html

4. Update Flask routes to handle both full page loads and HTMX requests
   - Add HTMX request detection
   - Return appropriate template based on request type
   - Success Criteria: Routes return full or partial templates correctly
   âœ“ COMPLETED: Updated Flask routes with HTMX request handling

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Implementation completed for dashboard_summary:
1. Added template inheritance blocks to base.html
2. Updated dashboard_summary.html to extend base.html
3. Created partial version in partials/dashboard_summary.html
4. Modified Flask routes to handle both full page loads and HTMX requests

Next steps:
1. Apply the same changes to dashboard.html
2. Apply the same changes to accounts.html
3. Apply the same changes to logs.html

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
The initial implementation for dashboard_summary.html is complete. Please test the following:
1. Navigate to /dashboard directly (should show full page with navigation)
2. Click dashboard link in navigation (should update content area only)
3. Refresh the page (should maintain layout and styling)

If these tests pass, we can proceed with updating the remaining templates.

## Lessons
- Always implement proper template inheritance from the start
- Separate full page templates from partial templates for HTMX
- Check request headers to determine appropriate template response
- Keep base styles in the base template for consistent layout

# Dashboard Overview Restoration Plan

## Background and Motivation
- The dashboard overview content was accidentally changed during template inheritance implementation

   - trades_executed list with account_id and count
3. Need to preserve template inheritance while restoring content

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Restore dashboard_summary.html content
   - Keep template inheritance structure (extends base.html)
   - Restore original dashboard container with loading states
   - Add back the active accounts counter
   - Restore trades executed table
   - Success Criteria: Dashboard shows active accounts and trades executed table

2. Restore dashboard_summary partial template
   - Create matching partial version without inheritance
   - Keep all functionality intact
   - Success Criteria: Partial template works with HTMX requests

3. Update JavaScript initialization
   - Restore original loadDashboardData function
   - Keep visibility enforcement
   - Maintain error handling
   - Success Criteria: Dashboard data loads and updates properly

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Implementation completed:
1. Restored original dashboard overview content in dashboard_summary.html
2. Created matching partial template in partials/dashboard_summary.html
3. Restored original JavaScript functionality with proper initialization and error handling

Ready for testing:
1. Navigate to /dashboard directly (should show full page with navigation)
2. Click dashboard link in navigation (should update content area only)
3. Refresh the page (should maintain layout and styling)
4. Verify active accounts counter updates
5. Verify trades executed table populates correctly

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Please test the restored dashboard functionality:
1. The dashboard should show the number of active accounts
2. The trades executed table should show trades per account for the current date
3. All styling should be consistent whether loaded directly or via HTMX
4. Error states should be properly handled and displayed

## Lessons
- Keep backups before making major template changes
- Test template inheritance changes carefully
- Maintain original functionality while improving structure
