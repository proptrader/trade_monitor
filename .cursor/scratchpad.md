# Background and Motivation
The project is moving to a SPA/HTMX navigation model for a more app-like experience. The navigation bar will now include a Trades tab (for live/all trades) and a Dashboard tab (for summary/overview). The main page will be blank. All navigation will use HTMX for partial updates, and active tab styling will be managed via JavaScript.

Recently, we encountered a critical issue where the Dashboard Overview and Export to Google Sheets functionality only worked when Tailwind CSS was disabled. This required a comprehensive approach to fixing the interaction between the HTMX/SPA architecture and Tailwind CSS.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Ensuring all content routes return partials, not full HTML pages.
- Updating all navigation and JS to use `/trades` instead of `/dashboard` for the trades tab.
- Implementing a summary dashboard for account/trade stats.
- Managing active tab styling in a SPA context.
- **Critical Issue**: Dashboard Overview and Export to Google Sheets functionality not working with Tailwind CSS enabled.
  - Root cause: Tailwind was interfering with JavaScript initialization and DOM visibility.
  - Tailwind's on-demand CSS was causing timing issues with component initialization.
  - Inconsistent element visibility when Tailwind was loaded versus disabled.

# High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] Update navigation bar in `base.html`:
    - Add "Trades" tab after "Dashboard".
    - Use `hx-get`, `hx-target`, and `hx-push-url` for all tabs.
    - Set `href` to `/dashboard`, `/trades`, `/accounts`, `/logs` as appropriate.
- [x] Update Flask routes:
    - `/dashboard` returns summary/overview partial (active accounts, trades per account, trades copied).
    - `/trades` returns live/all trades tabbed interface partial.
    - `/` returns a blank partial.
- [x] Update all navigation and JS references from `/dashboard` to `/trades` for the trades tab.
- [x] Implement JavaScript logic to update active tab styling on click.
- [x] Ensure all content pages are returned as partials (not full HTML).
- [x] Test navigation, content loading, and active tab styling.
- [x] **Fix Dashboard Overview and Export functionality with Tailwind enabled**:
    - Create robust Tailwind state detection and initialization system.
    - Add fallback styling to ensure visibility with or without Tailwind.
    - Implement multiple export methods for greater reliability.
    - Create comprehensive debugging panels to track DOM state and API calls.

# Fixed Issues - Detailed Changes
## 1. Base HTML Enhancements
- Added global `tailwindLoaded` state tracker to reliably detect when Tailwind is fully loaded
- Created `runWhenTailwindReady` utility function to ensure code runs only after Tailwind is ready
- Added helper functions `elementExists` and `waitForElement` to locate DOM elements reliably
- Made `showToast` globally available via `window.showToast` for use in any loaded partial
- Implemented a custom `tailwind:ready` event that triggers when Tailwind is fully initialized
- Added a secondary `components:initialize` event to ensure all components are initialized in the right order

## 2. Dashboard Summary Improvements
- Added inline styles as fallbacks to ensure content is visible regardless of CSS state
- Created a CSS visibility enforcement mechanism with !important rules
- Added multiple initialization paths to handle different loading scenarios
- Enhanced debugging tools to track DOM state and API calls
- Created a fallback for `showToast` when loaded as a standalone partial
- Forced visibility of key elements with explicit style overrides
- Implemented both event-based and timeout-based initialization

## 3. Export Functionality Fixes
- Added inline styles to export buttons to ensure visibility with or without Tailwind
- Created alternative export forms that use direct HTML form submission as a fallback
- Added robust error checking and validation before export
- Implemented `updateExportButtonState` to manage button appearance based on selected trades
- Added mutation observers to detect dynamically added trades
- Created comprehensive debugging panel to track export process
- Added support for multiple trade selection methods

## 4. Backend API Enhancements
- Improved trade_ids handling to support both JSON and comma-separated formats
- Made account_id parameter optional by defaulting to the first active account
- Added robust error handling and detailed logging
- Enhanced trade data extraction with fallbacks for different field naming conventions
- Improved validation and error reporting

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
All issues have been resolved. The Dashboard Overview and Export to Google Sheets functionality now work properly regardless of whether Tailwind CSS is enabled or disabled.

# Lessons
- For SPA/HTMX navigation, always use partials and manage active tab state via JS.
- Update all references when renaming routes (e.g., `/dashboard` to `/trades`).
- When using dynamic CSS frameworks like Tailwind, always provide inline style fallbacks.
- Add robust event-based initialization to handle asynchronous loading of CSS frameworks.
- Track global state (like Tailwind loading) to coordinate component initialization.
- Implement multiple fallback mechanisms for critical functionality.
- Create comprehensive debugging tools to diagnose DOM and API interaction issues.
- Use direct HTML forms as an alternative to JavaScript fetch for mission-critical features.
- Add inline styles with !important rules to override potentially conflicting styles.
- Use event delegation for dynamically created elements.
- Track DOM mutations to respond to dynamic content changes.

# Trade Monitor - Access Token Initialization Plan

## Background and Motivation
- The application needs to initialize access tokens to empty strings at the start of each day
- This should only happen once per day when the app is first run
- This ensures a clean state for token management each day

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Need to track when the app was last initialized
2. Need to determine if it's a new day
3. Need to modify the access tokens in the config file
4. Need to ensure this happens only once per day
5. Need to handle this during app startup

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create a new initialization tracking file
   - Create `config/init_tracker.json` to store last initialization date
   - Success Criteria: File exists with proper structure

2. Add initialization check function to KiteService
   - Add method to check if initialization is needed
   - Compare current date with last initialization date
   - Success Criteria: Function correctly identifies when initialization is needed

3. Add token reset functionality
   - Add method to reset access tokens
   - Update config file with empty tokens
   - Update initialization tracker
   - Success Criteria: Tokens are reset and tracker is updated

4. Integrate with app startup
   - Modify app initialization to perform the check
   - Call token reset if needed
   - Success Criteria: Initialization happens automatically on app startup

## Project Status Board
- [x] Task 1: Create initialization tracker file
- [x] Task 2: Add initialization check function
- [x] Task 3: Add token reset functionality
- [x] Task 4: Integrate with app startup

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Implementation completed:
1. Created `config/init_tracker.json` to store last initialization date
2. Added `_check_and_reset_tokens()` method to KiteService
3. Modified `load_accounts()` to perform token reset check
4. Added INIT_TRACKER_PATH to app configuration

The implementation:
- Checks if token reset is needed by comparing current date with last initialization date
- Resets all access tokens to empty strings when needed
- Updates the tracker file with the current date after reset
- Handles all error cases with proper logging
- Only performs reset once per day on first run

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Implementation is complete and ready for testing. The system will now:
1. Initialize access tokens to empty strings at the start of each day
2. Only perform initialization once per day
3. Track initialization state in `config/init_tracker.json`
4. Handle all error cases gracefully with proper logging

## Lessons
- Always ensure proper date comparison using ISO format
- Keep track of initialization state in a separate file
- Handle file operations safely with proper error handling
- Use app configuration for file paths
- Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
