# Memory Bank

## Purpose
The memory bank maintains project context, requirements, technical decisions, and progress across sessions. This is crucial as my memory resets completely between sessions, and I rely entirely on the memory bank to understand the project and continue work effectively.

## Structure
The Memory Bank consists of core files in a clear hierarchy:

1. `projectbrief.md`: Foundation document defining project scope and requirements
2. `productContext.md`: Explains why this project exists and user experience goals
3. `activeContext.md`: Tracks current work focus and recent changes
4. `systemPatterns.md`: Documents system architecture and design patterns
5. `techContext.md`: Lists technologies, development setup, and technical constraints
6. `progress.md`: Tracks what works, what's left to build, and known issues

## Usage
These files should be updated regularly as the project evolves to maintain an accurate record of the project's state and direction.
